# Shortest problems on Codeforces (Updated 2021-06-25)

List of Codeforces problems with a short problem statement of 1000 characters or less. Sorted for each rating level.

## Background
Inspired by [this blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/91600) with lists of short problems but missing some from my bracket, I set out to compile a more complete list and also a SQL database to cater for customized queries. As a start, I have made a general list for all 1000+ problems with a statement of 1000 characters or less, ordered by statement length and rating.

I plan to add at least one more list filtered by tags and ratings but I have no idea how to best organize the duplicates, as the shortest problems with multiple tags will show up in many lists. Any suggestion is welcome. 

If there is any additional list you'd like to see, please let me know. For those feeling adventurous, a quick-and-dirty Python script as well as SQL data dump can be found within the repository, add battery to a MariaDB server and you are good to go.
