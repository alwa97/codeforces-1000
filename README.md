# Shortest problems on Codeforces

**1495+ problems with statements under 1000 characters**

*Updated: 2025-08-03*

## Why?

Long problem statements are annoying. Sometimes you spend more time reading than solving. This list has only problems with short, clear descriptions so you can:

- Practice more problems in the same time
- Focus on the actual algorithm, not parsing text
- Build confidence without getting lost in paragraphs
- Great for beginners who find long problems overwhelming
